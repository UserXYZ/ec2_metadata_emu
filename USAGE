Since the only parameter that you can give to your VM hypervisor that
influences cloud-init mechanism is their MAC address, that is your
starting point.
So, the steps to prepare emulator is as follows:

- determine IP range and MAC address range for your VMs
- fill the data in the database, in tables subnets and maps
- use make_iid.py to generate instance-id for VM based on its MAC
  address and hostname
- use make_ud.py to create base64 encoded userdata which goes into
  the database, if you need to have user-data returned from metadata server
- use make_pubk.py to create public keys for every VM instance, if needed.
  If it exists for a certain instance-id, it will be added to metadata.
